    "## 1. List and briefly define the possible states that define an instruction execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 possible states that define an instruction execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fetch:  The instruction is fetched from main memory, at the current program counter, and loaded into a register for processing (specifically the instruction register or IR).\n",
    "2. Decode: The fetched instruction is encoded, so in this state it is decoded, interpreted by the decoder, to determine the operation to be performed and the operands to be used.\n",
    "3. Execute: Here the ALU operation is executed/performed.  Specifically, the operation is executed following the instruction on the operands that was decoded before.\n",
    "4. Acess memory: The instruction may access memory only in order to load or store data. In order to load, the instruction copies a value from memory to a register. In order to store, the instruction copies a value from a register to memory.\n",
    "5. Update register-write back: There are two possible ways for this instruction to be fulfilled. The first one happens when the result of the instruction execution, performed by the ALU, is written back to a register. The second one happens when the result of the instruction execution, is written back to memory.\n",
    "6. Update PC-Stall: Here, the PC (program counter) needs to be updated in order to be able to work with new instructions. For this, the processor can be delayed, while waiting for data, and might need to be set to other memory address. \n",

    "## 2. What types of transfers must a computer's interconnection structure (e.g., bus) support? \n",
    "\n",
    "To fulfill the communication between a computer system and its components, a computer's interconnection structure must support the following types of transfer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory to processor & Processor to memory: this type of transfer involves the action of the processor reading data from memory or writing data to memory.\n",
    "* I/O to processor & Processor to I/O: this type of transfer involves the action of the processor reading data from an I/O device or sending data to an I/O devide. In both cases, a I/O module is used.\n",
    "* I/O to memory & Memory to I/O:This type of transfer is realized using a direct memory access (DMA). It involves the connecion/exchange of data between memory and an I/O module without relying on the processor.\n",

    "## 3. Consider a hypothetical 32-bit microprocessor having 32-bit instructions composed of two fields: the first byte contains the opcode and the remainder the immediate operand or an operand address. \n",
    "\n",
    "**a. What is the maximum directly addressable memory capacity (in bytes)?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the first byte (8 bits) containing the opcode and the remainder (24 bits) containing an operand address, the maximum directly addressable memory capacity will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$2^{24} = 16777216$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the result suggests 16 MB.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**b. Discuss the impact on the system speed if the microprocessor bus has:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   1. **32-bit local address bus and 16-bit local data bus**\n",
    "   \n",
    "The impact on the system speed will be negative for this case. The number of bus cycles needed for this case is 3: 1 for the address and 2 for the data. This is because the local address bus has is 32-bit, so the transfer of address to memory is done in one cycle, but the local data bus is 16-bit, so 2 cycles will be needed in order to access memory and fetch the 32-bit instruction.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2. **16-bit local address bus and 16-bit local data bus**\n",
    "   \n",
    "The impact on the system speed will also be negativo for this case. The number of bus cycles needed for this case is 4: 2 for the address and 2 for the data. The same reasoning as in part 1 is used to explained the data transfer process and justify the number of cycles.\n",
    "            \n",
    "**c. How many bits are needed for the program counter and the instruction register?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the PC, 24 bits are needed, since the first 8 are used for the opcode. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the IR, 32 bits are needed. \n",

However, due to internal pipeline delays, such as latch delay, the clock rate of the new processor has to be reduced to 2 GHz. What is the speedup achieves for a typical program?\n",
